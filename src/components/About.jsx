          Hi! It's James Andrewsâ€” but I go by Jimmy. I'm an aspiring software
          developer originally from Kansas City and currently a senior at
          Colorado College. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
          with a minor in Mathematics. I'm proud to combine my academic
          interests with my passion for problem-solving, technology, and
          building innovative solutions with code. Beyond academics, I'm also a
          dedicated athlete and play Division III varsity tennis.
          <br />
          <br />
          I thrive in collaborative environments where I can combine my
          technical skills with creativity to develop meaningful projects. From
          interning at major organizations to building personal coding projects,
          I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my technical expertise
          and explore the latest in software development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my professional
          journey, personal projects, and interests. I'm always open to
          connecting, so don't hesitate to reach out via email or LinkedIn!
